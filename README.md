# ML_notes

This is my machine learning notes reposity which will consist of **Classic algorithm** and **State of art**

## Classic algorithm

This part mainly contain following algorithms:

- Linear regression
- Logistic regression
- Naive Bayes
- Shadow neural network
- Support vector machine
- Decision tree
- ...

They may be used less than ever, but they are fundamental

## State of art

This part mainly contain following algorithms:

- Deep neural network related algorithm and method
- Ensemble learning about trees such as GBDT, lightGBM, XGboost, etc

These have affected our life profoundly and turned out quite useful for now
